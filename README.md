This is the canonical repo for `automata-mk2`, my personal re-implementation of [Automata](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/Automata), which is a custom Discord bot used in the **[MUNCSS](https://muncompsci.ca)** Discord server.

Like the original bot, this is also implemented in Python and licensed under MIT.

As of **26 January, 2026**: this project is not finished, nor is it implemented into the official MUNCSS Discord.
